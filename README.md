# Adiabatic Invariants Calculations for Cluster mission: codes.

### Codes for Phase Space Density (PSD) conversion of Cluster/RAPID/IES electron data.

The codes include:
* matlab script to compute the second invariant K
* Python script to compute Lstars with 1-min resolution
* set of Python functions to convert Cluster/RAPID/IES electron flux to 


The result product is available through Cluster science archive ('LSTAR' product).
When using the 'LSTAR' product please add the DOI for this code to references.



For computations, one needs the information from cdf files taken from Cluster science
archive and Kp index from OMNI data (with 1-hour resolution).
